# E-commerce Data Analysis & Strategic Insights 📊

### 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on a deep-dive analysis of an e-commerce platform's sales data. The goal was to identify key revenue drivers, analyze user behavior across different technical segments, and provide actionable business recommendations to optimize the conversion funnel.

### 🛠️ Tech StackSQL (Google BigQuery): 

* Advanced data extraction using complex JOINs, CTEs, and window functions to prepare a unified dataset from raw session and transaction tables.

* Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy):

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, seasonality checks, and statistical correlation testing (e.g., analyzing the relationship between traffic volume and macro-conversion).

* Tableau:

Creation of an interactive executive dashboard to track KPIs, geographical sales distribution, and device-specific performance.

### 📈 Key Analysis HighlightsGeographical Performance:

* Identified the top 5 markets responsible for the majority of global revenue.

* User Behavior Segmentation:

Analyzed the impact of newsletter subscriptions and email verification status on purchase frequency.

* Technical Deep-Dive:

Evaluated conversion rates across different Device Models and Browsers to identify technical friction points.

* Statistical Validation:

Calculated correlation coefficients to verify the strength of the relationship between user engagement metrics and final sales.

## 🧩 Case Study: 
A/B Testing Perspective
The project also demonstrates the ability to evaluate experimental data, focusing on:
* Significance Testing: Determining if changes in user behavior are statistically significant ($p < 0.05$).
* Segmented Insights: Breaking down global results into specific regions or devices to find "hidden" winners or losers within a test.
